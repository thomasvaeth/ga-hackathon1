# Weekend Front End Hackathon
### About
The assignment was to build something cool while using a front end library that I have not used before. I made a random page doing a bunch of things that I have been wanting to do, but just have not been able to fit in previously.

### Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
  - Radial gradient
  - Blend mode
* JavaScript
* jQuery and jQuery UI
* Google Fonts
* Font Awesome
* fullPage.js
* Typed.js
* Lettering.js
* BigVideo.js
* Animate.CSS

### Unsolved Problems
* I decided early on to not make the project responsive.
